# Patients Emergency Room Visits Report - Power BI
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of patient visits to the emergency room. The analysis aims to uncover trends and insights that can help to improve patient experience and operational efficiency in the emergency department.

## Objective
The project aims to create a comprehensive and efficient system for recording and tracking patients' emergency room visits. This involves developing a platform that provides accurate and timely reports for medical staff and administrators, ultimately improving the overall management and analysis of emergency room visits to enhance patient care and resource allocation.

## Dataset Description
- [Hospital ER.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15525327/Hospital.ER.csv) - Dataset used for analyzing patient visits to the emergency room.

The dataset includes various columns:
- **Date**: Date and time of the visit.
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Patient Gender**: Gender of the patient.
- **Patient Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Patient SAT Score**: Patient satisfaction score.
- **Patient First Initial**: First initial of the patientâ€™s first name.
- **Patient Last Name**: Last name of the patient.
- **Patient Race**: Race or ethnicity of the patient.
- **Patient Admin Flag**: Indicates if the patient has any special administrative considerations.
- **Patient Wait Time**: Total wait time in minutes.
- **Department Referral**: Department to which the patient was referred.

## Project Insights

1.Average Wait Time Analysis: This insight focuses on understanding the typical wait times patients experience before their appointments. Analyzing trends and patterns in wait times can reveal inefficiencies in the healthcare system and help identify areas for improvement.

2.Patient Satisfaction Investigation: Examining average satisfaction scores provided by patients offers valuable insights into factors contributing to positive experiences. Understanding these factors enables healthcare providers to enhance patient satisfaction and overall quality of care.

3.Total Patient Visits Monthly: Tracking the total number of patient visits each month provides an overview of the demand for healthcare services over time. This insight helps in resource allocation, staffing decisions, and understanding seasonal variations in healthcare demand.

4.Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: Distinguishing between appointments involving administrative processes and those that don't allows for a deeper understanding of their impact on wait times and patient satisfaction. This insight can inform strategies to streamline administrative tasks and improve overall patient experience.

5.Referrals and Walk-In Patients Analysis: Exploring the balance between patients referred to specific departments and walk-in patients without prior referral provides insights into patient flow and resource utilization. Understanding this balance helps in optimizing departmental workflows and enhancing the patient experience.

6.Patient Visits by Age Group and Race: Analyzing the distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races highlights the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences. This insight informs targeted healthcare interventions and ensures inclusivity in service delivery.

7.Patients by Weektype: Examining patient visits categorized by weektype (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends) helps understand variations in healthcare demand based on temporal factors. This insight aids in staffing optimization and resource planning to meet fluctuating demand throughout the week.

8.Total Patients Visit by Year: Tracking the total number of patient visits by year provides insights into long-term trends in healthcare utilization. This insight helps healthcare organizations plan for future resource needs and adapt to changing patient demographics.

9.Service Not Rated: Identifying instances where services are not rated by patients sheds light on potential gaps in feedback collection processes. Understanding why certain services go unrated helps in improving data collection methods and ensuring comprehensive feedback.

10.Average Wait Time Analysis: Reiterating the importance of analyzing average wait times, this insight emphasizes its critical role in assessing healthcare system efficiency and patient satisfaction.
